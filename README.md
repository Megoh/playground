## 🚀 Technologies Covered
This repository includes hands-on projects and code samples in the following areas:

### 🔹 Backend Development
- **Spring Boot** – REST API development, dependency injection, and transaction management
- **Spring Data JPA** – Database interactions, entity mappings, and performance tuning

### 🔹 Databases
- **PostgreSQL** – SQL best practices, indexing, and query optimization

### 🔹 DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker & Kubernetes** – Containerization, orchestration, and deployment
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions and Jenkins for automated deployment

## 🎯 Goals
- Master key technologies used in backend development and DevOps.
- Gain hands-on experience with production-like architectures.
- Improve debugging, testing, and performance tuning skills.
- Build projects that demonstrate real-world problem-solving.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Implement a **Spring Boot CRUD API** with PostgreSQL.
- Deploy a **microservices architecture** using Kubernetes.
- Optimize SQL queries and benchmark database performance.
- Automate CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitHub Actions.
